Added Information
=================
GLITCHES/BUGS

When the game starts multiple raindrops will fall instead of one.  After this happens, though, the raindrops fall in sync with the timer.

The GitHub application on my home computer is not synced with GitHub or the same with my GitHub application at school.

To start the game, you would have to click the start screen multiple times before it worked.  Problem FIXED-isolated the restart button to only the game over screen.

The congratulations screen would only stay open for a certain amount of time and then the game would continue on.  Problem FIXED
